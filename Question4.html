<!-- Write a short note on Tag and element with an example? -->
 Ans: In HTML, tags are used to define the start and end of an HTML element. Tags are written inside angle brackets, like <h1> or </h1>. There are both opening (<tag>) and closing (</tag>) tags for most elements.

 An element consists of the opening tag, the content between them, and the closing tag. Elements are the building blocks of an HTML document.
 example: <h1>This is a heading</h1>
