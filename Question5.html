<!-- What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML? -->
The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is an instruction at the top of an HTML document that informs the web browser about the version of HTML being used. It ensures that the document is rendered correctly and consistently across different browsers. In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is simplified and looks like this.
Example: <!DOCTYPE html>
